# Excel Project 1

** Title:** [Heart Health Insight Dashboard]

**Tools Used:** Micosoft Excel (Excel formulas, Get Pivot Data, Pivot Table, Pivot Chat, Slicers, Timelines, and many more)

**Project Description:** This project explores key factors contributing to heart conditions using a dataset focused on demographic, lifestyle, and regional variables. The dashboard, built entirely in Excel, provides an interactive and visual analysis to help stakeholders identify trends and risk factors related to heart health.
Key features of the dashboard include:
1.	Patients by Age Group: A bar chart categorizing patients into different age groups to identify the most affected demographics.
2.	Patients by Sex Distribution: A pie chart showing the proportion of male, female, and other genders, aiding in demographic analysis.
3.	Heart Attack Rate by Region: A horizontal bar chart displaying the prevalence of heart attacks across regions.
4.	Heart Attack Rate by BMI Category: A column chart highlighting the relationship between BMI categories (Normal, Overweight, Obese) and heart attack occurrences.
5.	Smoking Status vs Heart Attack: A clustered bar chart visualizing the impact of smoking habits on heart attack rates.
6.	Key Metrics and Filters:
o	Total patients, total heart attack cases, and heart attack percentage are displayed as KPIs for a quick overview.
o	Interactive slicers allow users to filter data dynamically by Age Group, Sex, Region, and Smoking Status.

**Key findings:**
1. Demographic Trends
The 46–55 age group has the highest number of heart attack cases, closely followed by the 36–45 age group, highlighting that middle-aged adults are the most affected demographic.
The 56+ age group shows a significant drop in cases compared to the 46–55 group, possibly due to survival bias or better health management in older adults.
Males and females have nearly equal representation (48% each), with Other genders accounting for 4%.
2. Lifestyle Factors
Smoking: Smokers experience heart attacks slightly more frequently than non-smokers:

Smokers with heart attacks: 26,630.
Non-smokers with heart attacks: 26,843.
However, the difference between smokers and non-smokers appears marginal, suggesting other factors may play a stronger role.
BMI:

Obese individuals account for the highest heart attack rates (124,392 cases), nearly double that of the Normal BMI group (80,188 cases).
Overweight individuals exhibit relatively fewer cases (62,206 cases), suggesting a tipping point in risk levels between overweight and obese patients.
3. Regional Insights
All regions show relatively similar heart attack rates, with only minor variations:
North: 53,529 cases.
South: 53,381 cases.
Central: 53,472 cases.
East: 53,059 cases.
West: 53,345 cases.
These similar rates suggest that regional disparities are not significant in this dataset.
4. Overall Health Metrics
Heart Attack Rate: The heart attack rate is 20.04%, meaning roughly 1 in 5 patients experiences a heart attack.
Total Patients: The dataset includes 266,786 patients, of whom 53,473 have experienced a heart attack.
Next Steps
Target Obesity Interventions:
Focus on reducing BMI through weight management programs, as obesity is strongly correlated with heart attacks.
Refine Smoking Insights:
Although the smoker vs. non-smoker difference is small, further analysis may reveal if smoking interacts with other factors like age or BMI.
Age-Focused Campaigns:
Create awareness programs targeting the 36–55 age group, where heart attack risks are highest.
Validate Regional Data:
While regional disparities are minimal, further investigation could uncover micro-level variations within regions.
