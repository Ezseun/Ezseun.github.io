# Project 1

## Title: Heart Health Insight Dashboard

Tools Used: Excel

Project Description: 
This project explores key factors contributing to heart conditions using a dataset focused on demographic, lifestyle, and regional variables. The dashboard, built entirely in Excel, provides an interactive and visual analysis to help stakeholders identify trends and risk factors related to heart health.
Key features of the dashboard include:
1.	Patients by Age Group: A bar chart categorizing patients into different age groups to identify the most affected demographics.
2.	Patients by Sex Distribution: A pie chart showing the proportion of male, female, and other genders, aiding in demographic analysis.
3.	Heart Attack Rate by Region: A horizontal bar chart displaying the prevalence of heart attacks across regions.
4.	Heart Attack Rate by BMI Category: A column chart highlighting the relationship between BMI categories (Normal, Overweight, Obese) and heart attack occurrences.
5.	Smoking Status vs Heart Attack: A clustered bar chart visualizing the impact of smoking habits on heart attack rates.
6.	Key Metrics and Filters:
o	Total patients, total heart attack cases, and heart attack percentage are displayed as KPIs for a quick overview.
o	Interactive slicers allow users to filter data dynamically by Age Group, Sex, Region, and Smoking Status.
